### Top 10 Must-Know Answers

**1. Project Overview**
*"Classifies students into 4 types using 7 ML algorithms based on academic and lifestyle habits."*

**2. Best Algorithm**
*"Random Forest achieved highest accuracy due to ensemble approach and overfitting reduction."*

**3. Dataset Size**
*"150 balanced records with 6 features and 4 target classes."*

**4. Supervised vs Unsupervised**
*"Supervised uses labeled data for prediction; unsupervised finds patterns without labels."*

**5. Why Random Forest**
*"Combines multiple decision trees, reduces overfitting, handles non-linearity, robust to noise."*

**6. Train-Test Split**
*"80-20 split to evaluate model on unseen data and prevent overfitting."*

**7. PCA Purpose**
*"Reduces 6 dimensions to 2 while preserving variance, enables visualization."*

**8. Flask Choice**
*"Lightweight, easy deployment, Python integration, perfect for ML applications."*

**9. Model Persistence**
*"Pickle serializes model to file, enables deployment without retraining."*
